Towers of Hanoi 
The 'Towers of Hanoi' is a classical problem used to illustrate the power of recursion. The puzzle goes as follows. 

There are three poles and 64 discs of different sizes. Initially, all the discs are placed on the first pole with the largest disc at the bottom and the smallest one at the top. We need to move all the discs from the first pole to the third pole, with the smallest disc at the top and the largest at the bottom. We can move only one disc at a time (which should be the topmost disc) and at any point of time, a larger disc cannot be placed over a smaller one i.e. all the discs on a pole must be placed in such a way that the smallest is at the top and the largest at the bottom. The second pole can be used as an intermediate pole to help us in transferring the discs. 

This puzzle can be solved using recursion. For a moment, assume that there are just two discs (disc 1 and 2; disc 2 being the larger one) on the first pole. The solution consists of three steps. 

Step 1: Move disc 1 from pole 1 to pole 2.
Step 2: Move disc 2 from pole 1 to pole 3.
Step 3: Move disc 1 from pole 1 to pole 3.


Now, assume that disc 1 is not a single disc but a collection of discs. The procedure would be similar to the above three steps, but steps 1 and 3 would be a collection of steps. Step 1 would be to move the n-1 discs (assuming that there were a total of n discs) from pole 1 to pole 2. For moving these (n -1) discs, we again follow the same strategy of considering them as 1 disc plus a set of n-2 discs. Step 3 would also be similar. This gives us the recursive solution.
